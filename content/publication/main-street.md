abstract = "This proposal is aimed at developing a research design which will allow me to demonstrate clearly the economic impact of the Main Street Program in participating towns and cities. The Main Street Program (MSP) was initiated in the late 1970s as a branch of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Its goal is to provide resources to small towns and provide a path toward “revitalizing or strengthening a downtown or commercial district’s economy.” Its fundamental approach to revitalization is to transform towns and cities through incremental change rather than massive leveraged expenditures (megaprojects) or or “smokestack chasing.” The program’s four “transformation strategies”—economic vitality, design, promotion, and organization—are each designed to bring about a comprehensive economic revitalization. My research objective is to measure whether the Main Street Program affects job creation in participating communities. To ensure that my analysis is truly identifying the effect of the MSP on job creation, I will account for between-community differences along a variety of dimensions, such as demographic composition or human capital stocks. Furthermore, I will account for the differences in economic and demographic trends prior to a community’s joining of the MSP. By identifying communities that are similar to one another in all ways except MSP membership, I will be able to demonstrate whether or not the program had an effect on job creation."
