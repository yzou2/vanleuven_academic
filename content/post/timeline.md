Recently, a friend shared with me a tweet by [an economist](https://twitter.com/NicDuquette) who had plotted out the timeline of his first five research papers in order to demonstrate the length of time required for progress toward publication in the social sciences. It is a sobering reminder of how challenging it can be to acheive "success" as an aspiring academic, but it was also an re-affirmation of something I've been told before: *diversify your research efforts*.

It is one thing to be incredibly passionate and dedicated to a single topic or idea. That is a key ingredient for successfully defending a dissertation and becoming a true 'master' of that one slice of knowledge. However, in my [limited] experience, too much emphasis on a single topic often leads to *burnout*. That is why I have tried to stay engaged in multiple streams of research that focus on different topic areas and use different approaches.

Here is my version[^1] of the "research timeline" I've followed in my time thus far as a PhD student:

It's nothing special...probably something I should have waited to publish until I had at least one accepted article. However, it was a fun exercise[^2] in data visualization and a good reminder of the progress I have made in two short years. The cool part (for me, at least) is that, even though there are only four articles there are still **three** quite separate "streams" of interest:

* regional economics,
* public management, and
* policy analysis.

Obviously, as time goes by I will not be able to maintain such a small paper-to-topic-area ratio. However, I do plan to continue expanding my horizons as I develop a long-term pipeline for research both 1) because I want to avoid becoming burnt-out with a single topic or idea and 2) because I believe it is healthy to continually look for new and exciting sources of research questions and answers.
